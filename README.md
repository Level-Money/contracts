## Level Protcol Contracts

The Level Protocol is structured around the ERC-20 `lvlUSD` stablecoin and its staked counterpart `slvlUSD`. `LevelMinting` allows institutional participants to mint `lvlUSD` by collateralizing stablecoins like USDC and USDT and to redeem collateral by burning `lvlUSD`. `StakedlvlUSD` allows users to stake their `lvlUSD` to gain exposure to long-tailed basis trade positions and to earn yield -- this exposure is tokenized by `slvlUSD`. `Freezer` enables a first-loss protection mechanism by which stakers take on risk to protect the value of `lvlUSD`: while `slvlUSD` may accrue yield, it may also lose a portion of its value when `lvlUSD` held by the staking contract is frozen to preserve the value of `lvlUSD`. `Slasher` is responsible for burning `lvlUSD`.

## lvlUSD

`lvlUSD` is an ERC20 stablecoin token that supports denylisting, minting, and burning. Denylisted addresses are not allowed to transfer or receive `lvlUSD`.
The admin can designate up to one _minter_. This designation can be revoked and changed at any time. The minter is allowed to mint `lvlUSD` to a non-denylisted receiver address.

## LevelMinting

`LevelMinting` is inspired by and built on top of Ethena protocol's `EthenaMinting` [contract](https://github.com/ethena-labs/code4arena-contest/blob/main/protocols/USDe/contracts/EthenaMinting.sol). It controls the supply of `lvlUSD` in circulation by allowing approved minters and redeemers to mint `lvlUSD` by depositing collateral assets (e.g. USDC, USDT) and redeem assets by burning `lvlUSD` in a 1:1 ratio. Redemptions are done in a two-step process when cooldowns are enabled -- by default users have to wait 7 days to redeem their collateral.

| mint()                                        | This function atomically swaps a supported stablecoin from a benefactor address to lvlUSD that’s sent to a beneficiary address. The conversion rate is assumed to be one-to-one. This function can only be called by an address with the minter permission. The contract can also define a max. mint amount per unit of time. Mints that exceed that amount will fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Minter         |
| redeem()                                      | This function can only be called when cooldown for redemptions is turned off. It atomically and immediately swaps lvlUSD from a benefactor address to a supportedAsset that’s sent to a beneficiary address. The conversion rate is assumed to be one-to-one. The lvlUSD that is sent to be redeemed is burned. This function can only be called by an address with the redeemer permission. The contract can also define a max. redeem amount per unit of time. Redemptions that exceed that amount will fail. To support redemptions, the LevelMinting contract will need to hold collateral assets, namely other stablecoins. These reserves are managed by LevelReserveManager. | Redeemer       |
| initiateRedeem()                              | This function can only be called when cooldowns for redemptions are enabled (`cooldownDuration` > 0). It initiates the redemption process by storing the user's order request in contract storage and by starting a timer, after which the request may be fulfilled via `completeRedeem`. Other aspects of this function are the same as `redeem`. By default, the cooldown period is set to be 7 days. This gives LevelReserveManager time to unstake collateral and transfer them back to LevelMinting so that redemptions from users can be fulfilled.                                                                                                                           | Redeemer       |
| completeRedeem()                              | This function can only be called when cooldowns for redemptions are enabled (`cooldownDuration` > 0). This functions calls the internal `_redeem` function to fulfill a user's redemption request, and should be called after the user waits for `cooldownDuration` after calling `initiateRedeem`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Redeemer       |
